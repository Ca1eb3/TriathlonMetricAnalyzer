# TriathlonMetricAnalyzer
An application intended to leverage your swim, bike, and run training data pulled from strava to give a more wholistic overview of triathlon training.

## Current Product State
Much of the instability has been resolved but features are still very basic. Also note a request needs to be made with Strava to allow more users. This will be done once all of the Strava API guidelines are met.
